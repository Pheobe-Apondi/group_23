###ALGORITHM
1. Gather a list of VMs with details on peak usage, function, and resource needs.
2. Sort the VMs in descending order by peak usage to prioritize those with the highest demand.
3. For each VM, allocate resources according to its function:
                                                          High Processing Power: Assign to servers with strong CPU capabilities.
                                                          Large Storage Needs: Place on servers with ample storage capacity.
                                                          High RAM Requirements: Allocate to servers equipped with sufficient RAM.
4. Review the list to find VMs that are not currently in use.
5. The VMs identified as idle initiate a sleep mode to reduce power consumption while maintaining their state for quick reactivation.
6. Identify the VMs that rely on each other for data exchange and group them accordingly.
7. Place dependent virtual machines (VMs) on the same server or on nearby servers to minimize physical distance and reduce latency.
8. Break data into smaller packets for transmission to enhance reliability and efficiency in communication.
9. Ensure data travels via the shortest path between dependent VMs  to minimize delays.
